# Challenges: JS Callback Functions

The following four exercises build on each other. The first three challenges let you exercise how to write callback functions.

If the names used for functions seem unclear at the beginning (e.g. `onSuccess()` instead of `callback()`), the fourth exercise will clear everything up.
